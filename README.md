# React Native Vision Camera Animal Identifier

This is a React Native project that utilizes the Vision Camera library to identify animals through a camera interface.

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Ensure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
Step 2: Start Your Application
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

For Android
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
For iOS
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly, provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

Step 3: Modifying Your App
Now that you have successfully run the app, you can modify it.

Open App.tsx in your text editor of choice and make your changes.
For Android: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows and Linux, or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) to see your changes. For iOS: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and view your changes.
